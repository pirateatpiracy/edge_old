Customer Loyalty Program

Question. A retail company with various outlets across the country maintains logs centrally of customer's purchases (amount spent). The company is running a Customer Loyality Campaign to award customer having highest total purchase in June 2017.

Your task is to write a MapReduce or Spark program to find out Customer ID whose total spend was highest in June 2017. Assume that there are hundreds of files stored already on HDFS having the schema shown below.

- Each transaction is written in a new line with Month (MMM), Year (YYYY), Customer ID & Total Bill Amount. These fields are separated by "-" .
- Transactions written to the log file are not necessarily in order by date. 
- Total number of transactions recorded in each log file may vary. 
- There can be multiple records for a Customer on a given day across any number of different outlets, each of which is recorded individually to the log file.

Sample File:
May-2017-120-245.50
Jun-2017-124-21.50
Jun-2017-110-34.00
Jun-2017-120-200.00
Jul-2017-124-546.50
Jul-2017-110-1500.00
Jun-2017-124-245.50

1st Record:
May-2017 -> Month & Year of purchase
120 -> Customer ID
245.50 -> Bill Amount
